# TopfiBot
TopfiBot is an open-source multifunctional bot for Discord (discordapp.com). The process of development hasn't come too far yet, 
but all committed in the master branch should be stable to use (please notice that features are quite limited right now).
## Concept
TopfiBot is made to provide a wide range of features in an easy way. 
It'll contain features like:
- Playing music in voice channels (MusicBot)
- Tools for server-admins
- Ranking system
- Tools for text-channels
- Some funny stuff
## Dependencies
The bot uses the following external libraries:
- JDA/JavaDiscordAPI
    The api-wrapper the bot uses to communicate with the official Discord-API.
